# **Introduction**
Alpine Treeline Ecotones (ATEs) are transitional zones between subalpine Forest and Alpine (tundra) ecotones (Holtmeier – Broll 2005, Winings 20013) also referred to as upper-treeline (Elliott 2017) and occur globally (Singh – Dharaiya – Mohapatra 2015, Bader – Llambí – Chase – Buckley – Toivonen – Camaerero – Cairn – Brown – Wiegand – Resler 2020). They span between the actual Timberline/Economic Forest Line though the Upper/Physiognomic-Biologic Forest Line and the tree species line which is adjoining the actual Alpine zone (Chhetri – Thai 2019, 1543). The position of the treeline is influenced by multiple factors at local and regional level, but  temperature has been identified as the global driving  factor (Körner 1998, Körner – Paulsen 2004, Holtmeier – Broll 2005, Bader 2007, Barredo – Mauri – Caudullo 2020). The global pattern can be described by spatial patterns in the x-y plane (discrete or diffuse, Figure 1) and by changes in tree stature (abrupt or gradual, Figure 2) in a multi-dimensional space (Harsch – Bader 2011, Bader – Llambí – Chase – Buckley – Toivonen – Camarero – Cairn – Brown – Wiegand – Resler 2020).

Although recognized, the distribution of ATE patterns have neither been mapped, nor been described yet, let alone explained. Earlier studies have identified abrupt, diffuse, island and krummholz spatial patterns of ATEs (Harsch – Hulme – McGlone – Duncan 2009, Harsch – Bader 2011, Figure 2). As seen, treelines dispaly a high variability and differ in multiple dimensions. A comparison of multiple studies suggest, that the different spatial patterns of ATEs reflect fundamental ecological controlling processes and that different ATEs react differently to climate change (Harsch – Bader 2011, Figure 1) Figure 3.

Right: Matrix of the multidimensional state space of treeline forms depicting extreme cases of the different dimensions. Columns represent the  spatial patterns in the x-y plane and rows the change in tree stature (size and shape). The lines represents the hypothesized first-level ecological processes behind the patterns along an elevational gradient. The dotted line displays the growth limitation, the dashed line the dieback and the continuous line the mortality. Growth limitation always occurs while dieback only affects if krummholz is involved.

To better understand and categorize ATEs a standardized description and terminology of spatial patterns has been proposed on hillslope and landscape scale by Bader – Llambí – Chase – Buckley – Toivonen – Camarero – Cairn – Brown – Wiegand – Resler 2020, including hypotheses for the general mechanisms behind the patterns. The terminology and the multidimensional state-space can be most clearly understood from Figure 4. 

After the definition and the characterization of the spatial patterns of ATEs, the following overview of ATE research shall serve as a basis for the workflow proposed in this methodological paper to globally detect ATEs.
