  abstract = {The circum-Arctic transitional zone between forest and tundra, i.e. the treeline zone, is shifting northward due to current Arctic warming and, therefore, requires systematic monitoring. Up to now, radar remote sensing was hardly possible in the treeline zone due to spatial resolution and/or temporal decorrelation constraints of preceding satellite missions. The unique constellation of the TanDEM-X satellites with its bistatic mode and very high spatial resolution opens up opportunities for monitoring small (≥0.01\,km2) and isolated patches of very sparse forest which are typical for the transitional zone. We focused on an area at the northern edge of the treeline zone in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and evaluated the potential of TanDEM-X bistatic data to characterize the tree height in the forest patches in this region. TanDEM-X data were acquired during the TanDEM-X Science Phase in 2015, when the perpendicular baseline was large (corresponding to the height of ambiguity of approximately 14.6\,m) and kept constant. We employed TanDEM-X backscatter, bistatic coherence, and interferometric height from the stack of seven multitemporal bistatic pairs and compared them to maximum vegetation height obtained from full-waveform airborne LiDAR data. We found strong linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and LiDAR vegetation height within the forest patches with r\,=\,0.67, r\,=\,−0.69, and r\,=\,0.78 for the backscatter, coherence, and interferometric height, respectively. Furthermore, we extracted the position of individual trees from the LiDAR data and estimated tree density as the number of trees per unit area. The linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and the tree density were very weak. The relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and tree height differentiated for three tree density classes (low, medium, and high) remained strong. Random forests regression using all three TanDEM-X metrics predicted the tree height with a mean absolute error of 0.7\,m (mean forest height in the study area was 2.5\,m). CoSSC pairs were generally consistent with each other and the multitemporal averaging slightly improved the performance compared to single pairs. Taking into account the global coverage of bistatic TanDEM-X data acquired for the global digital elevation model, our results show a potential for quantifying the tree height in small forest patches along the circum-Arctic treeline zone.},

  abstract = {Northward shift of the treeline is expected circum-Arctic and has been observed in a number of locations in response to Arctic warming. The transitional zone between forest and tundra is, therefore, a vulnerable region that requires systematic monitoring. Currently, radar remote sensing is hardly employed in the treeline zone. The unique constellation of the TanDEM-X satellites with its bistatic mode and unprecedented spatial resolution opens new opportunities for monitoring of the treeline zone. We focus on an area near the Trail Valley Creek research basin in the east of the Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories, Canada. The area lies at the northern edge of the treeline zone. Erect vegetation there is characterised by deciduous shrubs up to 3 m in height and isolated patches of sparse coniferous forest. We evaluate the potential of TanDEM-X bistatic data to characterise the structural properties of the forest patches. The TanDEM-X data were acquired during the TanDEM-X Science Phase in 2015, when the effective baseline was large and constant (approximately 540 m). We employ interferometric coherence from multitemporal bistatic pairs and compare it with standard vegetation metrics obtained from airborne LiDAR data. The full-waveform airborne LiDAR data were captured in September 2016, covering an area of about 20 km x 6 km with a point density of approximately 5 points per square meter. LiDAR metrics include vegetation height percentiles and vegetation ratio. The preliminary analysis shows a high agreement between TanDEM-X bistatic coherence and LiDAR vegetation metrics. The relation between coherence and LiDAR metrics, averaged for each forest patch, yields in a strong inverse correlation, varying from -0.81 to -0.88 for different LiDAR metrics. On sub- atch scale, spatial patterns of coherence and LiDAR metrics also show high inverse correspondence. Thus, a pixel-by-pixel comparison gives a first-shot correlation between tree height 99 percentile and coherence from -0.45 to -0.63 for different forest patches. Taking into account the global coverage of multiple bistatic TanDEM-X data acquired for the global digital elevation model, our results provide a basis for the quantification of the treeline properties circum-Arctic.},

  abstract = {Treeline dynamics have inevitable impacts on the forest treeline structure and composition. The present research sought to estimate treeline movement and structural shifts in response to recent warming in Cehennemdere, Turkey. After implementing an atmospheric correction, the geo-shifting of images was performed to match images together for a per pixel trend analysis. We developed a new approach based on the NDVI, LST (land surface temperature) data, air temperature data, and forest stand maps for a 43-year period. The forest treeline border was mapped on the forest stand maps for 1970, 1992, 2002, and 2013 to identify shifts in the treeline altitudes, and then profile statistics were calculated for each period. Twenty sample plots (10\,×\,10 pixels) were selected to estimate the NDVI and LST shifts across the forest timberline using per-pixel trend analysis and non-parametric Spearman’s correlation analysis. In addition, the spatial and temporal shifts in treeline tree species were computed within the selected plots for four time periods on the forest stand maps to determine the pioneer tree species.},

  abstract = {Globally, treeline ecotones vary from abrupt lines to extended zones of increasingly small, stunted and/or dispersed trees. These spatial patterns contain information about the processes that control treeline dynamics. Describing these patterns consistently along ecologically meaningful dimensions is needed for generalizing hypotheses and knowledge about controlling processes and expected treeline shifts globally. However, existing spatial categorizations of treelines are very loosely defined, leading to ambiguities in their use and interpretation. To help better understand treeline-forming processes, we present a new framework for describing alpine treeline ecotones, focusing on hillside-scale patterns, using pattern dimensions with distinct indicative values: 1) the spatial pattern in the x-y plane: a) decline in tree cover, and b) change in the level of clustering. Variation along these dimensions results in more or less ‘discrete' or ‘diffuse' treelines with or without islands. These patterns mainly indicate demographic processes: establishment and mortality. 2) Changes in tree stature: a) decline in tree height, and b) change in tree shape. Variation along these dimensions results in more or less ‘abrupt' or ‘gradual' treelines with or without the formation of environmental krummholz. These patterns mainly indicate growth and dieback processes. Additionally, tree population structure can help distinguish alternative hypotheses about pattern formation, while analysing the functional composition of the ecotonal vegetation is essential to understand community-level processes, controlled by species-specific demographic processes. Our graphical representation of this framework can be used to place any treeline pattern in the proposed multi-dimensional space to guide hypotheses on underlying processes and associated dynamics. To quantify the dimensions and facilitate comparative research, we advocate a joint effort in gathering and analysing spatial patterns from treelines globally. The improved recognition of treeline patterns should allow more effective comparative research and monitoring and advance our understanding of treeline-forming processes and vegetation dynamics in response to climate warming.},

  abstract = {Aim To present a method that assesses the influence of environmental variables, including climate, substrate, topography, and anthropogenic disturbances, on the distribution of Andean forest at the tree line, and to compare this forest distribution between areas. Location Sangay National Park, on the eastern slopes of the Andes in central Ecuador. Methods A logistic regression model was built using topographical variables and environmental indices, derived from a digital elevation model, to explain forest cover, derived from a Landsat ETM image, in a zone around the average tree line altitude. Results The model shows that after altitude, which can explain about 80\% of forest cover, wetness has the next strongest effect (areas accumulating water, but also cold air, were devoid of forest, resulting in inverted tree lines), followed by eastness (western slopes had forest to higher altitudes). Application of the model in two nearby areas showed that the real tree line was lower than the predicted tree line in both areas, probably owing mainly to macroclimatic differences in one area, and partly also to human land use in the other. The locations with the largest deviations could be the focus of further research concerning human impacts on tree line vegetation. Main conclusions The tree line is located at lower altitudes on east-facing slopes, which may be because high levels of radiation are received by east-facing slopes in the clear mornings, resulting in the photoinhibition of tree seedlings in the páramo. In spite of the limitations of the quality and resolution of the remote sensing data, the presented method provides indications for important ecological factors at the tree line. The method also allows the detection of differences in tree line position between areas, which may reflect climatic differences or the location of anthropogenic disturbances.},

  abstract = {Alpine treeline ecotones can be gradual transitions, abrupt boundaries, or patchy mosaics, and these different patterns may indicate important processes and dynamic properties. We present observed spatial patterns of a wide range of tropical treelines and try to explain these patterns. Treelines were studied at seven sites in the tropical and subtropical Andes (Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) and on a Hawaiian volcano (Haleakala, Maui). Treeline vegetation structure was described using transects perpendicular to the treeline, and air and soil temperatures were measured above and below the forest boundary. Temperature fluctuations were much larger and the average temperature was higher in alpine vegetation than in forest. Most treelines were abrupt, with surprisingly similar patterns across a wide geographical range. This abruptness could result from positive feedback processes mediated by the differences in microclimate between forest and páramo. Our data is not conclusive about the relative importance of microclimate as opposed to fire in mediating such feedbacks. However, our extensive set of comparable data from different sites in a large geographical region is an important step toward a better understanding of the nature and dynamics of tropical alpine treelines.},

The structure of this mosaic affects species habitat and potential ecotone response to global change. However, the alpine forest-tundra ecotone may be insensitive to climatic change if it is a climatic relict or is frequently disturbed. We used GIS and multivariate statistics to (1) analyze landscape structure in transects across the ecotone in Rocky Mountain National Park, (2) identify the major variants of forest-tundra ecotone, and (3) identify the influence of the environment and natural disturbances on variation in the landscape structure of the ecotone. There are six major types of ecotone varying in the amount of natural disturbances, permanent features (e.g., lakes), closed forest, patch forest, and krummholz. Variation is primarily related to slope, elevation, aspect, and geology associated with the morphology of the mountains and the disturbances they produce. The ecotone is not strongly structured by natural disturbances; thus, it may be more strongly controlled by and sensitive to climatic change than in areas where disturbance is more prevalent. Monitoring of potential ecotone response to global change is feasible, if tailored to the types of ecotone and their expected response.},

  abstract = {Climatic change may alter vegetation composition and structure, but the response to climatic change can be expected to be spatially heterogeneous. Tree populations in the alpine forest–tundra ecotone, for example, may find only certain locations to be favourable for regeneration and growth. If monitoring and detection of vegetation responses to climatic change is to be most successful, the monitoring system must be tuned to the locations where a response is most likely. We used the grass geographical information system (gis) to map population parameters indicating potential change throughout the forest–tundra ecotone (FTE) of Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP). Seedling density in patch forest and krummholz openings, as well as annual krummholz height growth, were measured in the field. These parameters were then modelled over the heterogeneity of the FTE environment, using principle components regression analysis. The grass gis was used to extrapolate the resulting predictive equations to the entire RMNP FTE. Potential FTE responses to climate change were evaluated in the context of species-specific differences in how tree seedling density and krummholz height growth are associated with the present environment. For example, climate change leading towards moister conditions, causing currently xeric environments to become more mesic, might increase the spatial extent of existing tree invasion into patch forest openings. This would increase the potential for widespread conversion of patch forest to closed forest. Present population parameters extrapolated spatially may provide a useful guide to where future change is likely.},

Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess changes 1) in the spatial range of the alpine tundra domain (ATD), and 2) in elevational shifts of the treeline ecotone in Europe under scenarios of climate change. We used 11 regional climate model (RCM) simulations from EURO CORDEX [https://www.euro-cordex.net], disaggregated at the 1 km grid size, representing two RCP scenarios, i.e. RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, in three warming periods i.e. 1.5 °C, 2 °C and 3 °C and the 2050s (2036-2065).Findings of this study indicate a pronounced contraction of the ATD across regions, scenarios and periods. First, in the Alps, with a 1.5 °C warming it is projected that the ATD will lose an extent of around 31-36\% with respect to the reference period (1981-2010). Comparable results were obtained using both scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. In the 3 °C warming period the extent of the ATD in the Alps is projected to be only 19\% of the present extent. Second, in the Scandes, a contraction of the ATD of around 50\% in the 1.5 °C warming period is projected in both scenarios. Then, in the 3 °C warming period most of the ATD is projected to disappear, with only 8\% of ATD projected to persist. Lastly, in the Pyrenees the projections are worse than in the Alps and Scandes. The contraction of ATD is already projected above 74\% in the 1.5 °C warming period in both scenarios. Then, in the 2 °C warming period only a marginal 4\% of ATD is projected to persist, and virtually disappears in the 3 °C warming.},

  abstract = {Aim High-elevation forest line or tree line is an ecological ecotone representing the upper elevation thermal limit for forest development. The current tree line position is the result of the past human activity interacting with climatic and topographic conditions. In this study, we investigate how climate, local topographic factors and anthropogenic disturbance currently affect tree line distribution. Location Apennine Mountains, 900 km latitudinal gradient along the Italian Peninsula. Methods Overall, 302 mountain peaks were studied, comprising 3,622 km of measured tree lines. The position of the Fagus sylvatica tree line in all peaks was assessed and correlated with 58 selected variables representing climate, topography and human disturbance. Results The mean tree line elevation was 1,589 m a.s.l., with considerable variability among peaks. Contrary to our expectations, the tree line elevation was lower in the warmer southerly exposed slopes compared to north-facing aspects, where we found the highest tree line (2,141 m a.s.l.). Correlation analysis indicates that both climatic and human density variables are associated with tree line elevation, with the climate having more influence in high elevation mountains, while human impact plays a prominent role in low elevation mountain peaks. Specifically, we found negative correlations between density of the resident population around each peak and tree line elevation at all examined dates (1861, 1921, and 2011), suggesting a pervasive negative impact of human activity on tree lines. As regards climatic variables, tree line elevation showed a stronger negative correlation with winter and spring months temperature than with mean annual temperature. Noteworthy, climatic variables had stronger effect on high elevation peaks ({$>$}1,900 m a.s.l.) compared with low elevation ones ({$<$}1,900 m a.s.l.). Main Conclusion Our data provide evidence that the current position of the F. sylvatica tree line in the Apennines is heavily depressed as a result of a complex interaction between climatic factors and the past human pressure.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them.

Four treeline transition vegetation types including closed-canopy forest, open-canopy forest, meadow, and unvegetated surfaces (e.g. rock, snow, and ice) were identified and mapped through classification of satellite data and subsequent field verification. Topographic characteristics were represented using a digital elevation model and three variables derived from topoclimatic potential models (solar radiation potential, snow accumulation potential, and soil saturation potential). A combination of generalized additive and generalized linear modeling (GAM and GLM, respectively) techniques was used to construct logistic regression models representing the distributions of the four vegetation types. The variables explained significant amounts of variation in the vegetation types, but high levels of variation remained unexplained. A comparison of 'expected' and 'observed' vegetation patterns suggested that some unexplained variation may have occurred at the basin scale. A suite of tools and techniques is presented that facilitates predicting landscape-scale vegetation patterns and testing hypotheses about the spatial controls on those patterns.]}

  abstract = {The tundra-taiga boundary stretches for more than 13,400 km around the Northern Hemisphere and is probably the Earth's greatest vegetation transition. The trees that define the boundary have been sensitive to climate changes in the past and models of future vegetation distribution suggest a rapid and dramatic invasion of the tundra by the taiga. Such changes would generate both positive and negative feedbacks to the climate system and the balance could result in a net warming effect. However, the boundary is becoming increasingly affected by human activities that remove trees and degrade forest-tundra into tundra-like areas. Because of the vastness and remoteness of the tundra-taiga boundary, and of methodological problems such as problematic definitions and lack of standardized methods to record the location and characteristics of the ecotone, a project group has been established under the auspices of the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC). This paper summarizes the initial output of the group and focuses on our uncertainties in understanding the current processes at the tundra-taiga boundary and the conflicts between model predictions of changes in the location of the boundary and contrasting recently observed changes due to human activities. Finally, we present recommendations for a coordinated international approach to the problem and invite the international community to join us in reducing the uncertainties about the dynamics of the ecotone and their consequences.},

  abstract = {Alpine treeline ecotones display spatial variability in a range of features that often reflect underlying abiotic variation and its control on the processes that form and maintain treelines. In this study, we explore treeline pattern–environment relationships for continuous, abrupt Nothofagus treelines in New Zealand across a seven degree latitudinal gradient (circa 39–46° S). Our main aims were: 1) to develop a set of metrics for characterising spatial variation in abrupt treelines at a landscape scale; 2) to relate these metrics to underlying abiotic variation in order to determine the relative roles of climate, substrate, topography and disturbance in structuring Nothofagus treeline patterns; and 3) to develop a possible biogeographic typology of Nothofagus treelines. A GIS-based approach was used to develop seven metrics describing different facets of landscape-scale treeline pattern. Regression modelling and variance partitioning were used to explore relationships among treeline pattern metrics and abiotic variation. Cluster analysis was used to characterise emergent treeline types and GIS was used to map their biogeographic distributions. The individual treeline metrics characterised unique patterns of treeline variation across New Zealand and, upon clustering, resulted in seven distinctive treeline types. Nothofagus treeline patterns in New Zealand are strongly structured by environmental gradients, with about half the landscape-scale variation in treelines being structured by patterns of abiotic variation. Gradients of climatic and disturbance were most influential in explaining landscape-scale variation of individual treeline metrics and of multivariate treeline patterns. The presented, metric-based approach offers a means to develop a comprehensive picture of continuous, landscape-scale treeline variation, bridging an existing research gap between studies at site and global scales. Our approach can enable the development biogeographic treeline typologies that could facilitate the comparison of treeline patterns across large areas and provide a basis for the generation of new hypotheses regarding treeline formation and dynamics.},

While numerous treeline species have recently experienced range advance along their upper elevational boundary, this has been species- and region-dependent. Making an accurate prediction of how taxa will respond is essential for conservation and land management, as treeline advance is likely to result in a loss of alpine biodiversity through habitat change and fragmentation. Predicting any species response requires an understanding of the current physical and climatic determinants of its distribution. We used the Maxent species distribution modeling software to predict the likelihood of treeline advance in the Nepalese Himalayas by modeling the extent of suitable habitats for 3 dominant treeline species—Abies spectabilis, Betula utilis, and Pinus wallichiana—under present and projected climate conditions. Temperature-related climatic variables and elevation explained the greatest amount of variance in the distribution of the study species. Under projected climate conditions, we found a regional increase in suitable habitat for all 3 treeline species, predicting a potential for northward and upslope advance.},

Understanding what environmental drivers control the position of the alpine tree line is important for refining our understanding of plant stress and tree development, as well as for climate change studies. However, monitoring the location of the tree line position and potential movement is difficult due to cost and technical challenges, as well as a lack of a clear boundary. Advanced remote sensing technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) offer significant potential to map short individual tree crowns within the transition zone despite the lack of predictive capacity. Process-based forest growth models offer a complementary approach by quantifying the environmental stresses trees experience at the tree line, allowing transition zones to be defined and ultimately mapped. In this study, we investigate the role remote sensing and physiological, ecosystem-based modeling can play in the delineation of the alpine tree line. To do so, we utilize airborne LiDAR data to map tree height and stand density across a series of altitudinal gradients from below to above the tree line within the Swiss National Park (SNP), Switzerland. We then utilize a simple process-based model to assess the importance of seasonal variations on four climatically related variables that impose non-linear constraints on photosynthesis. Our results indicate that all methods predict the tree line to within a 50 m altitudinal zone and indicate that aspect is not a driver of significant variations in tree line position in the region. Tree cover, rather than tree height is the main discriminator of the tree line at higher elevations. Temperatures in fall and spring are responsible for the major differences along altitudinal zones, however, changes in evaporative demand also control plant growth at lower altitudes. Our results indicate that the two methods provide complementary information on tree line location and, when combined, provide additional insights into potentially endangered forest/grassland transition zones.}

Despite the potential of such shifts as indicators of global change effects in mountain ecosystems, there are relatively few works focused on their assessment in a systematic and spatially explicit way. In this work our aim is to quantify the altitudinal shifts and analyse the spatial pattern dynamics of mountain ecotones. We developed a novel procedure to delineate the current and former state of three characteristic mountain ecotones, which we formalised as forest, tree and tundra lines. Our approach is based on the recognition of altitudinal extreme outposts identified with ecotone locations at a slope scale. The integration of multi-temporal datasets allows the identification and quantification of altitudinal advances and retreats in the outpost locations for a given period. We tested the method in a section of the Italian Alps for the period 1957–2003. Results show a general trend of an increase in altitude for the three ecotones, despite the occurrence of occasional decreases. We estimate decadal altitude increments of 25m for forest line, 13m for treeline and 11m for tundra line. We also identified changes in ecotone spatial morphology between the two dates, with significant implications in connectivity and colonisation dynamics.},

However, the automated detection of tree species based on passive remote sensing data from aerial surveys is still not sufficiently developed to achieve reliable results independent of the phenological stage, time of day, season, tree vitality and prevailing atmospheric conditions. Here, we introduce a novel tree species classification approach based on high resolution RGB image data gathered during automated UAV flights that overcomes these insufficiencies. For the classification task, a computationally lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed. We show that with the chosen CNN model architecture, average classification accuracies of 92\% can be reached independently of the illumination conditions and the phenological stages of four different tree species. We also show that a minimal ground sampling density of 1.6 cm/px is needed for the classification model to be able to make use of the spatial-structural information in the data. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the presented approach to derive spatially explicit tree species information, a gridded product is generated that yields an average classification accuracy of 88\%.},

  abstract = {An ecotone is a boundary or transition zone between types of vegetation or biomes that is bracketed by more homogeneous types. Ecotones are created by environmental gradients that ultimately govern the physiological and reproductive range limits of species from adjacent ecosystems. On a global scale the most prominent and well-studied ecotones are those between forests and lower-stature vegetation in the Arctic, on mountains, and across savannas. The history of treeline research is rich with examples of terminological misunderstanding and issues of spatial scale. Given the relatively high levels of stress imposed on species growing at or near the edge of what may be referred to as their bioclimatic envelope, the dynamics of ecotone boundaries are widely considered to be sensitive proxies for climate variability, especially for warming at arctic and alpine treelines. Savanna ecotones present a contrast in that indirect processes such as fire complicate the environmental gradient.},

  abstract = {Treeline responses to climate change ultimately depend on successful seedling recruitment, which requires dispersal of viable seeds and establishment of individual propagules in novel environments. In this study, we evaluated the effects of several abiotic and biotic drivers of early tree seedling recruitment across an alpine treeline ecotone. In two consecutive years, we sowed seeds of low- and high-elevation provenances of Larix decidua (European larch) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) below, at, and above the current treeline into intact vegetation and into open microsites with artificially removed surface vegetation, as well as into plots protected from seed predators and herbivores. Seedling emergence and early establishment in treatment and in control plots were monitored over two years. Tree seedling emergence occurred at and several hundred metres above the current treeline when viable seeds and suitable microsites for germination were available. However, dense vegetation cover at lower elevations and winter mortality at higher elevations particularly limited early recruitment. Post-dispersal predation, species, and provenance also affected emergence and early establishment. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding multiple abiotic and biotic drivers of early seedling recruitment that should be incorporated into predictions of treeline dynamics under climate change.},

  abstract = {In this study, we automate tree species classification and mapping using field-based training data, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a convolutional neural network classifier (CNN). We tested our methods by identifying seven dominant trees species as well as dead standing trees in a mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, CA (USA) using training, validation, and testing datasets composed of spatially-explicit transects and plots sampled across a single strip of imaging spectroscopy. We also used a three-band \&lsquo;Red-Green-Blue\&rsquo; pseudo true-color subset of the hyperspectral imagery strip to test the classification accuracy of a CNN model without the additional non-visible spectral data provided in the hyperspectral imagery. Our classifier is pixel-based rather than object based, although we use three-dimensional structural information from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to identify trees (points \&gt; 5 m above the ground) and the classifier was applied to image pixels that were thus identified as tree crowns. By training a CNN classifier using field data and hyperspectral imagery, we were able to accurately identify tree species and predict their distribution, as well as the distribution of tree mortality, across the landscape. Using a window size of 15 pixels and eight hidden convolutional layers, a CNN model classified the correct species of 713 individual trees from hyperspectral imagery with an average F-score of 0.87 and F-scores ranging from 0.67\&ndash;0.95 depending on species. The CNN classification model performance increased from a combined F-score of 0.64 for the Red-Green-Blue model to a combined F-score of 0.87 for the hyperspectral model. The hyperspectral CNN model captures the species composition changes across \textasciitilde 700 meters (1935 to 2630 m) of elevation from a lower-elevation mixed oak conifer forest to a higher-elevation fir-dominated coniferous forest. High resolution tree species maps can support forest ecosystem monitoring and management, and identifying dead trees aids landscape assessment of forest mortality resulting from drought, insects and pathogens. We publicly provide our code to apply deep learning classifiers to tree species identification from geospatial imagery and field training data.},

  abstract = {Data processing for forestry applications is challenged by the increasing availability of multi-source and multi-temporal data. The advancements of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have made it a prominent family of methods for machine learning and artificial intelligence. This review determines the current state-of-the-art in using DL for solving forestry problems. Although DL has shown potential for various estimation tasks, the applications of DL to forestry are in their infancy. The main study line has related to comparing various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures between each other and against more shallow machine learning techniques. The main asset of DL is the possibility to internally learn multi-scale features without an explicit feature extraction step, which many people typically perceive as a black box approach. According to a comprehensive literature review, we identified challenges related to (1) acquiring sufficient amounts of representative and labelled training data, (2) difficulties to select suitable DL architecture and hyperparameterization among many methodological choices and (3) susceptibility to overlearn the training data and consequent risks related to the generalizability of the predictions, which can however be reduced by proper choices on the above. We recognized possibilities in building time-series prediction strategies upon Recurrent Neural Network architectures and, more generally, re-thinking forestry applications in terms of components inherent to DL. Nevertheless, DL applications remain data-driven, in contrast to being based on causal reasoning, and currently lack many best practices of conventional forestry modelling approaches. The benefits of DL depend on the application, and the practitioners are advised to ex ante subject their requirements to operational data availability, for example. By this review, we contribute to the technical discussion about the prospects of DL for forestry and shed light on properties that require attention from the practitioners.},

Response to climate warming over the last century, however, has been mixed, with some treelines showing evidence of recruitment at higher altitudes and/or latitudes (advance) whereas others reveal no marked change in the upper limit of tree establishment. To explore this variation, we analysed a global dataset of 166 sites for which treeline dynamics had been recorded since 1900 AD. Advance was recorded at 52\% of sites with only 1\% reporting treeline recession. Treelines that experienced strong winter warming were more likely to have advanced, and treelines with a diffuse form were more likely to have advanced than those with an abrupt or krummholz form. Diffuse treelines may be more responsive to warming because they are more strongly growth limited, whereas other treeline forms may be subject to additional constraints.},

  abstract = {Aim Treelines occur globally within a narrow range of mean growing season temperatures, suggesting that low-temperature growth limitation determines the position of the treeline. However, treelines also exhibit features that indicate that other mechanisms, such as biomass loss not resulting in mortality (dieback) and mortality, determine treeline position and dynamics. Debate regarding the mechanisms controlling treeline position and dynamics may be resolved by identifying the mechanisms controlling prominent treeline spatial patterns (or ‘form’) such as the spatial structure of the transition from closed forest to the tree limit. Recent treeline studies world-wide have confirmed a close link between form and dynamics. Location The concepts presented refer to alpine treelines globally. Methods In this review, we describe how varying dominance of three general ‘first-level’ mechanisms (tree performance: growth limitation, seedling mortality and dieback) result in different treeline forms, what ‘second-level’ mechanisms (stresses, e.g. freezing damage, photoinhibition) may underlie these general mechanisms, and how they are modulated by interactions with neighbours (‘third-level’ mechanisms). This hierarchy of mechanisms should facilitate discussions about treeline formation and dynamics. Results We distinguish four primary treeline forms: diffuse, abrupt, island and krummholz. Growth limitation is dominant only at the diffuse treeline, which is the form that has most frequently responded as expected to growing-season warming, whereas the other forms are controlled by dieback and seedling mortality and are relatively unresponsive. Main conclusions Treeline form provides a means for explaining the current variability in treeline position and dynamics and for exploring the general mechanisms controlling the responses of treelines to climatic change. Form indicates the relative dependence of tree performance on various aspects of the external climate (especially summer warmth versus winter stressors) and on internal feedbacks, thus allowing inferences on the type as well as strength of climate-change responses.},

Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.},

Landscape metrics are a widely used tool for the analysis of patch-based, discrete land-cover classes. Existing software to calculate landscape metrics has several constraints, such as being limited to a single platform, not being open-source or involving a complicated integration into large workflows. We present landscapemetrics, an open-source R package that overcomes many constraints of existing landscape metric software. The package includes an extensive collection of commonly used landscape metrics in a tidy workflow. To facilitate the integration into large workflows, landscapemetrics is based on a well-established spatial framework in R. This allows pre-processing of land-cover maps or further statistical analysis without importing and exporting the data from and to different software environments. Additionally, the package provides many utility functions to visualize, extract, and sample landscape metrics. Lastly, we provide building-blocks to motivate the development and integration of new metrics in the future. We demonstrate the usage and advantages of landscapemetrics by analysing the influence of different sampling schemes on the estimation of landscape metrics. In so doing, we demonstrate the many advantages of the package, especially its easy integration into large workflows. These new developments should help with the integration of landscape analysis in ecological research, given that ecologists are increasingly using R for the statistical analysis, modelling and visualization of spatial data.},

  abstract = {An ecotone is a zone of vegetation transition between two communities, often resulting from a natural or anthropogenic environmental gradient. In remotely sensed imagery, an ecotone may appear as an edge, a boundary of mixed pixels or a zone of continuous variation, depending on the spatial scale of the vegetation communities and their transition zone in relation to the spatial resolution of the imagery. Often in image classification, an ecotone is either ignored if it falls within a width of one or two pixels, or part of it may be mapped as a separate vegetation community if it covers an area of several pixel widths. A soft classification method, such as probability mapping, is inherently appealing for mapping vegetation transition. Ideally, the probability of membership each pixel has to each vegetation class corresponds with the proportional composition of vegetation classes per pixel. In this paper we investigate the use of class probability mapping to produce a softened classification of an alpine treeline ecotone in Austria using a SPOT 5 HRG image. Here the transition with altitude is from dense subalpine forest to treeless alpine meadow and herbaceous vegetation. The posterior probabilities from a Maximum Likelihood algorithm are shown to reflect the land-cover composition of mixed pixels in the ecotone. The relationships between the posterior probability of class membership for the two end-member classes of ‘scrub and forest’ and ‘non-forest vegetation’ and the percentage ground cover of these vegetation classes (enumerated in 15~quadrats from 1:1500 aerial photographs) were highly significant: r     \textsuperscript{2}     =0.83 and r     \textsuperscript{2}     =0.85 respectively (p\&lt;0.001, n=15). We identify thresholds (alpha-cuts) in the posterior probabilities of class membership of ‘scrub and forest’ and ‘non-forest vegetation’ to map the alpine treeline ecotone as a transition zone of five intermediate vegetation classes between the end-member communities. In addition, we investigate the representation of the ecotone as a ratio between the posterior probabilities of ‘scrub and forest’ and ‘non-forest vegetation’. This displays the vegetation transition without imposing subjective boundaries, and has greater emphasis on the ecotone transition rather than on the end-member communities. We comment on the fitness for purpose of the different ways investigated for representing the alpine treeline ecotone.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity and response of northern hemisphere altitudinal and polar treelines to environmental change are increasingly discussed in terms of climate change, often forgetting that climate is only one aspect of environmental variation. As treeline heterogeneity increases from global to regional and smaller scales, assessment of treeline sensitivity at the landscape and local scales requires a more complex approach than at the global scale. The time scale (short-, medium-, long-term) also plays an important role when considering treeline sensitivity. The sensitivity of the treeline to a changing environment varies among different types of treeline. Treelines controlled mainly by orographic influences are not very susceptible to the effects of warming climates. Greatest sensitivity can be expected in anthropogenic treelines after the cessation of human activity. However, tree invasion into former forested areas above the anthropogenic forest limit is controlled by site conditions, and in particular, by microclimates and soils. Apart from changes in tree physiognomy, the spontaneous advance of young growth of forest-forming tree species into present treeless areas within the treeline ecotone and beyond the tree limit is considered to be the best indicator of treeline sensitivity to environmental change. The sensitivity of climatic treelines to climate warming varies both in the local and regional topographical conditions. Furthermore, treeline history and its after-effects also play an important role. The sensitivity of treelines to changes in given factors (e.g. winter snow pack, soil moisture, temperature, evaporation, etc.) may vary among areas with differing climatic characteristics. In general, forest will not advance in a closed front but will follow sites that became more favourable to tree establishment under the changed climatic conditions.},

Treelines will not advance in a closed front parallel to the shift of any isotherm to higher elevations and more northern latitudes. The effects of varying topography on site conditions and the after-effects of historical disturbances by natural and anthropogenic factors may override the effects of slightly higher average temperatures. Moreover, the varying treeline-forming species respond in different ways to a changing climate. Forest advance upwards and northwards primarily depends on successful regeneration and survival of young growth rather than on increasing growth rates of mature trees. Every assessment of treeline response to future climate change must consider the effects of local site conditions and feedbacks of increasing tree population in modulating the climatically-driven change. Treeline-shift will influence regional and local climates, pedogenesis, plant communities, animal populations and biodiversity as well as having a considerable effect on economic changes in primary production. A better understanding of the functional relationships between the many treeline-relevant factors and treeline dynamics can be achieved only by extensive research at different scales within different climatic regions supported by as many as possible experimental studies in the field together with laboratory and remote sensing techniques.},

It is, for example, important for issues such as wildlife habitat modeling and close-to-nature forest management. We examined the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite data for the identification of 10 tree species in a temperate forest in Austria. We performed a Random Forest (RF) classification (object-based and pixel-based) using spectra of manually delineated sunlit regions of tree crowns. The overall accuracy for classifying 10 tree species was around 82\% (8 bands, object-based). The class-specific producer’s accuracies ranged between 33\% (European hornbeam) and 94\% (European beech) and the user’s accuracies between 57\% (European hornbeam) and 92\% (Lawson’s cypress). The object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based approach. We could show that the 4 new WorldView-2 bands (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared 2) have only limited impact on classification accuracy if only the 4 main tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and English oak) are to be separated. However, classification accuracy increased significantly using the full spectral resolution if further tree species were included. Beside the impact on overall classification accuracy, the importance of the spectral bands was evaluated with two measures provided by RF. An in-depth analysis of the RF output was carried out to evaluate the impact of reference data quality and the resulting reliability of final class assignments. Finally, an extensive literature review on tree species classification comprising about 20 studies is presented.},

The ATE boundary spans a considerable elevational range, suggesting that shorter growing seasons with increasing elevation only partially explain the upper limits for this boundary.

Climatic changes that alter cloud frequency, wind, precipitation and ice loading at the upper elevations could influence shifts in the ATE boundary.},

  abstract = {In this review I first compile data for the worldwide position of climate-driven alpine treelines. Causes for treeline formation are then discussed with a global perspective. Available evidence suggests a combination of a general thermal boundary for tree growth, with regionally variable “modulatory” forces, including the presence of certain taxa. Much of the explanatory evidence found in the literature relates to these modulatory aspects at regional scales, whereas no good explanations emerged for the more fundamental global pattern related to temperature per se, on which this review is focused. I hypothesize that the life form “tree” is limited at treeline altitudes by the potential investment, rather than production, of assimilates (growth as such, rather than photosynthesis or the carbon balance, being limited). In shoots coupled to a cold atmosphere, meristem activity is suggested to be limited for much of the time, especially at night. By reducing soil heat flux during the growing season the forest canopy negatively affects root zone temperature. The lower threshold temperature for tissue growth and development appears to be higher than 3°C and lower than 10°C, possibly in the 5.5–7.5°C range, most commonly associated with seasonal means of air temperature at treeline positions. The physiological and developmental mechanisms responsible have yet to be analyzed. Root zone temperature, though largely unknown, is likely to be most critical.},

  abstract = {Aim At a coarse scale, the treelines of the world's mountains seem to follow a common isotherm, but the evidence for this has been indirect so far. Here we aim at underpinning this with facts. Location We present the results of a data-logging campaign at 46 treeline sites between 68° N and 42° S. Methods We measured root-zone temperatures with an hourly resolution over 1–3 years per site between 1996 and 2003. Results Disregarding taxon-, landuse- or fire-driven tree limits, high altitude climatic treelines are associated with a seasonal mean ground temperature of 6.7 °C (±0.8 SD; 2.2 K amplitude of means for different climatic zones), a surprisingly narrow range. Temperatures are higher (7–8 °C) in the temperate and Mediterranean zone treelines, and are lower in equatorial treelines (5–6 °C) and in the subarctic and boreal zone (6–7 °C). While air temperatures are higher than soil temperatures in warm periods, and are lower than soil temperatures in cold periods, daily means of air and soil temperature are almost the same at 6–7 °C, a physics driven coincidence with the global mean temperature at treeline. The length of the growing season, thermal extremes or thermal sums have no predictive value for treeline altitude on a global scale. Some Mediterranean (Fagus spp.) and temperate South Hemisphere treelines (Nothofagus spp.) and the native treeline in Hawaii (Metrosideros) are located at substantially higher isotherms and represent genus-specific boundaries rather than boundaries of the life-form tree. In seasonal climates, ground temperatures in winter (absolute minima) reflect local snow pack and seem uncritical. Main conclusions The data support the hypothesis of a common thermal threshold for forest growth at high elevation, but also reflect a moderate region and substantial taxonomic influence.},

We argue that the data of remote sensing and automated techniques of image processing should be preferably used. Accordingly, a color-infrared orthophoto map was classified in a land cover map employing maximum likelihood spectral classifier, ancillary data, texture analysis, and a knowledge base classification technique. The overall classification accuracy was about 78\%, distinguishing 7 land cover classes. Using a reclassified land cover map and the moving window mean filter, a spruce canopy closure map was calculated. The continuous map of the canopy closure was subsequently reclassified in predefined intervals that were used for an automated delimitation and mapping of complex transitional borders of the alpine treeline ecotone. The proposed method can serve for objectified mapping of gradual transitions between any land cover or vegetation classes.},

Although the neural network has achieved excellent performance in semantic segmentation in the last years, there are a few of works using CNN for sea-land segmentation and the results could be further improved. This paper proposes a novel deep convolution neural network named DeepUNet. Like the U-Net, its structure has a contracting path and an expansive path to get high resolution output. But differently, the DeepUNet uses DownBlocks instead of convolution layers in the contracting path and uses UpBlock in the expansive path. The two novel blocks bring two new connections that are U-connection and Plus connection. They are promoted to get more precise segmentation results. To verify our network architecture, we made a new challenging sea-land dataset and compare the DeepUNet on it with the SegNet and the U-Net. Experimental results show that DeepUNet achieved good performance compared with other architectures, especially in high-resolution remote sensing imagery.},

  abstract = {Alpine Treeline Ecotone (ATE), the typically gradual transition zone between closed canopy forest and alpine tundra vegetation in mountain regions, displays an elevational range that is generally constrained by thermal deficits. At landscape scales, precipitation and moisture regimes can suppress ATE elevation below thermal limits, causing variability in ATE position. Recent studies have investigated the relative effects of hydroclimatic variables on ATE position at multiple scales, but less attention has been given to interactions between hydroclimatic variables and disturbance agents, such as fire. Advances in monoplotting have enabled the extraction of canopy cover information from oblique photography. Using airborne lidar, and repeat photography from the Mountain Legacy Project, we observed canopy cover change in West Castle Watershed (Alberta, Canada; \textasciitilde 103 km2; 49.3\&deg; N, 114.4\&deg; W) over a 92-year period (1914\&ndash;2006). Two wildfires, occurring 1934 and 1936, provided an opportunity to compare topographic patterns of mortality and succession in the ATE, while factoring by exposure to fire. Aspect was a strong predictor of mortality and succession. Fire-exposed areas accounted for 83.6\% of all mortality, with 72.1\% of mortality occurring on south- and east-facing slope aspects. Succession was balanced between fire-exposed and unburned areas, with 62.0\% of all succession occurring on north- and east-facing slope aspects. The mean elevation increase in closed canopy forest (i.e., the lower boundary of ATE) on north- and east-facing undisturbed slopes was estimated to be 0.44 m per year, or \textasciitilde 44 m per century. The observed retardation of treeline advance on south-facing slopes is likely due to moisture limitation.},

Results indicate that considerable differences between random k-fold (R2~=~0.9 for Tair and 0.92 for VW) and target-oriented CV (LLO R2~=~0.24 for Tair and 0.49 for VW) exist, highlighting the need for target-oriented validation to avoid an overoptimistic view on models.

An automated Feature Extraction Module (Fx) implemented in ENVI is used to extract the tree crowns from a digitized panchromatic aerial photograph acquired in 1947 and a false colour aerial photograph from 2003 of an altitudinal foresttundra ecotone on Lommoltunturi fell (a mountain shaped by Pleistocene glaciations). The two step Fx process included segmentation and feature classification with support vector machines with textural, spatial and spectral channels as inputs. The change in the resulted relative crown areas of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and downy birch (Betula pubenscens) were then assessed in GIS analysis, and compared to forest inventory and age data of saplings and trees. Within the last 56 years, Norway spruce has expanded uphill, in terms of distance, approximately 100 m and birch 40 to 60 m. In accordance with the birch-pine-spruce succession concept, the downy birch dominated forest-tundra ecotone stands are now replaced by Norway spruce. The treeline of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) reach the fell top (557 m a.sl.). The spruce and birch treelines reach 510 m. We did not find water availability, soil temperature nor N to be limiting factors in expansion of spruce-birch forest but a surplus of Al relative to base cations may disfavour spruce on some sites in the tundra. Primarily, the harsh winter wind-climate and spatial variability in thickness of snow cover are presently restricting the regeneration of trees on the open tundra.},

This can be challenging, especially in biodiverse but extreme environments like the Himalaya. This study presents the results of the first ever application of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) imagery for species-level mapping of vegetation in the Himalaya following a hierarchical Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) method. The first level of classification separated green vegetated objects from the rest with overall accuracy of 95\%. At the second level, seven cover types were identified (including four woody vegetation species). For this, the suitability of various spectral, shape and textural features were tested for classifying them using an ensemble decision tree algorithm. Spectral features alone yielded \textasciitilde 70\% accuracy (kappa 0.66) whereas adding textural and shape features marginally improved the accuracy (73\%) but at the cost of a substantial increase in processing time. Contrast in plant morphological traits was the key to distinguishing nearby stands as different species. Hence, broad-leaved versus fine needle leaved vegetation were mapped more accurately than structurally similar classes such as Rhododendron anthopogon versus non-photosynthetic vegetation. Results highlight the potential and limitations of the suggested UAS-GEOBIA approach for detailed mapping of plant communities and suggests future research directions.},

Prior research on ATE dynamics has been primarily based on field inventory and studied at the community level. The potential of using remote sensing and geographic information system for the delineation of the treeline ecotone has been explored. In this study, we used satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from Landsat-1/2 Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Resourcesat-1/2 Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS-III), and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) to investigate long-term ATE dynamics. Satellite remote sensing of treeline in Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya revealed an upward shift over the past four decades. The ATE has shifted c. 452 m ± 74 m upward in vertical dimension at a rate c. 113 m decade−1. Furthermore, the land surface phenology along ATE and forest area has changed significantly over the past 33 years. The significant positive trend in length of the growing season (LOS; p {$<$} 0.05) and delay in the end of the growing season (EOS) was observed. The start of the growing season (SOS) had a negative tendency with non-significant linear trend. The treeline upward shift and significant lengthening of the growing season at ATE and forest area indicate changing climatic patterns and processes.},

  abstract = {Species range shifts have been well studied in light of rising global temperatures and the role climate plays in restricting species distribution. In mountain regions, global trends show upward elevational shifts of altitudinal treelines. However, there is significant variation in response between geographic locations driven by climatic and habitat heterogeneity and biotic interactions. Accurate estimation of treeline shifts requires fine-scale patterns of forest structure to be discriminated across mountain ranges. Satellite remote sensing allows detailed information on forest structure to be extrapolated across mountain ranges, however, variation in methodology combined with a lack of information on accuracy and repeatability has led to high uncertainty in the utility of remotely sensed data in studies of mountain treelines. We unite three themes; suitability of remote sensing products, ecological relevance of classifications and effectiveness of the training and validation process in relation to the study of mountain treeline ecotones. We identify needs for further research comparing the utility of different remotely sensed data sets, better characterisation of treeline structure and incorporation of accuracy assessment. Collectively, the improvements we describe will significantly improve the utility of remote sensing by facilitating a more consistent approach to defining geographic variation in treeline structure, improving our ability to link processes from stand to regional scale and the accuracy of range shift assessments. Ultimately, this advance will enable better monitoring of mountain treeline shifts and estimation of the associated to biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Global environmental changes are driving shifts in forest distribution across the globe with significant implications for biodiversity and ecosystem function. At the upper elevational limit of forest distribution, patterns of forest advance and stasis can be highly spatially variable. Reliable estimations of forest distribution shifts require assessments of forest change to account for variation in treeline advance across entire mountain ranges. Multispectral satellite remote sensing is well suited to this purpose and is particularly valuable in regions where the scope of field campaigns is restricted. However, there is little understanding of how much information about forest structure at the mountain treeline can be derived from multispectral remote sensing data. Here we combine field data from a structurally diverse treeline ecotone in the Central Mountain Range, Taiwan, with data from four multispectral satellite sensors (GeoEye, SPOT-7, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8) to identify spectral features that best explain variation in vegetation structure at the mountain treeline and the effect of sensor spatial resolution on the characterisation of structural variation. The green, red and short-wave infrared spectral bands and vegetation indices based on green and short-wave infrared bands offer the best characterisation of forest structure with R2 values reported up to 0.723. There is very little quantitative difference in the ability of the sensors tested here to discriminate between discrete descriptors of vegetation structure (difference of R2MF within 0.09). While Landsat-8 is less well suited to defining above-ground woody biomass (R2 0.12–0.29 lower than the alternative sensors), there is little difference between the relationships defined for GeoEye, SPOT-7 and Sentinel-2 data (difference in R2\,{$<$}\,0.03). Discrete classifications are best suited to the identification of forest structures indicative of treeline advance or stasis, using a simplified class designation to separate areas of old growth forest, forest advance and grassland habitats. Consequently, our results present a major opportunity to improve quantification of forest range shifts across mountain systems and to estimate the impacts of forest advance on biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

Here we present evidence from satellite data that the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation increased from 1981 to 1991 in a manner that is suggestive of an increase in plant growth associated with a lengthening of the active growing season. The regions exhibiting the greatest increase lie between 45°N and 70°N, where marked warming has occurred in the spring time3 due to an early disappearance of snow4. The satellite data are concordant with an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeding 20\% since the early 1970s, and an advance of up to seven days in the timing of the drawdown of CO2 in spring and early summer1. Thus, both the satellite data and the CO2 record indicate that the global carbon cycle has responded to interannual fluctuations in surface air temperature which, although small at the global scale, are regionally highly significant.},

  abstract = {The boreal tree line is expected to advance upwards into the mountains and northwards into the tundra due to global warming. The major objective of this study was to find out if it is possible to use high-resolution airborne laser scanner data to detect very small trees — the pioneers that are pushing the tree line up into the mountains and out onto the tundra. The study was conducted in a sub-alpine/alpine environment in southeast Norway. A total of 342 small trees of Norway spruce, Scots pine, and downy birch with tree heights ranging from 0.11 to 5.20~m were precisely georeferenced and measured in field. Laser data were collected with a pulse density of 7.7~m−2. Three different terrain models were used to process the airborne laser point cloud in order to assess the effects of different pre-processing parameters on small tree detection. Greater than 91\% of all trees {$>$}1~m tall registered positive laser height values regardless of terrain model. For smaller trees ({$<$}1~m), positive height values were found in 5–73\% of the cases, depending on the terrain model considered. For this group of trees, the highest rate of trees with positive height values was found for spruce. The more smoothed the terrain model was, the larger the portion of the trees that had positive laser height values. The accuracy of tree height derived from the laser data indicated a systematic underestimation of true tree height by 0.40 to 1.01~m. The standard deviation for the differences between laser-derived and field-measured tree heights was 0.11–0.73~m. Commission errors, i.e., the detection of terrain objects — rocks, hummocks — as trees, increased significantly as terrain smoothing increased. Thus, if no classification of objects into classes like small trees and terrain objects is possible, many non-tree objects with a positive height value cannot be separated from those actually being trees. In a monitoring context, i.e., repeated measurements over time, we argue that most other objects like terrain structures, rocks, and hummocks will remain stable over time while the trees will change as they grow and new trees are established. Thus, this study indicates that, given a high laser pulse density and a certain density of newly established trees, it would be possible to detect a sufficient portion of newly established trees over a 10~years period to claim that tree migration is taking place.},

  abstract = {In this thesis, the utility of airborne laser scanning (ALS) for monitoring vegetation of relevance for the environmental sector was investigated. The vegetation characteristics studied include measurements of biomass, biomass change and vegetation classification in the forest-tundra ecotone; afforestation of grasslands; and detection of windthrown trees. Prediction of tree biomass for mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) using sparse (1.4 points/m²) and dense (6.1 points/m²) ALS data was compared for a site at the forest-tundra ecotone near Abisko in northern Sweden (Lat. 68° N, Long. 19° E). The predictions using the sparse ALS data provided almost as good results (RMSE 21.2\%) as the results from the dense ALS data (18.7\%) despite the large difference in point densities. A new algorithm was developed to compensate for uneven distribution of the laser points without decimating the data; use of this algorithm reduced the RMSE for biomass prediction from 19.9\% to 18.7\% for the dense ALS data. Additional information about vegetation height and density from ALS data improved a satellite data classification of alpine vegetation, in particular for the willow and mountain birch classes. Histogram matching was shown to be effective for relative calibration of metrics from two ALS acquisitions collected over the same area using different scanners and flight parameters. Thus the difference between histogram-matched ALS metrics from different data acquisitions can be used to locate areas with unusual development of the vegetation. The height of small trees (0.3–2.6 m tall) in former pasture land near the Remnings¬torp test site in southern Sweden (Lat. 58° N, Long. 13° E) could be measured with high precision (standard deviation 0.3 m) using high point density ALS data (54 points/m2). When classifying trees taller than 1 m into the two classes of changed and unchanged, the overall classification accuracy was 88\%. A new method to automatically detect windthrown trees in forested areas was developed and evaluated at the Remningstorp test site. The overall detection rate was 38\% on tree-level, but when aggregating to 40 m square grid cells, at least one windthrown tree was detected in 77\% of the cells that according to field data contained windthrown trees. In summary, this thesis has shown the high potential for ALS to be a future tool to map and monitor vegetation for several applications of interest for the environmental sector.},

  abstract = {The effect of ongoing climate change on sub-arctic and alpine forests has led to increased interest in monitoring potential changes in the forest–tundra ecotone. In addition to climate change, insect damage, browsing pressure by herbivores such as moose and reindeer, as well as anthropogenic impacts will contribute to changes in the forest–tundra ecotone. These changes are difficult to monitor with manual methods because of the complex mosaic pattern of the ecotone. In this study, the possibility to predict maximum tree height, above ground tree biomass and canopy cover with airborne laser scanning (ALS) was therefore tested at a forest–tundra ecotone site near Abisko in northern Sweden (Lat. N 68°20′, Long. E 19°01′, 420-700ma.s.l.). The forest in the area is dominated by mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), which has highly irregular stem and canopy forms. Predictions from two different laser data acquisitions were compared. The first laser data set had 6.1pointsm−2 and was obtained in 2008 with a TopEye MKII scanner carried by a helicopter flown at 500m a.g.l. The second laser data set had 1.4pointsm−2 and was obtained in 2010 with an Optech ALTM Gemini scanner carried by a fixed-wing aircraft flown at 1740m a.g.l. Linear regression models were developed for the predictions using data from 73 sample plots with ten meter radius surveyed in 2009 and 2010. The relative RMSEs obtained for the TopEye and Optech data after leave-one-out cross-validation were, respectively, 8.8\% and 9.5\% for maximum tree height; 18.7\% and 21.2\% for above ground tree biomass; and, 16.8\% and 18.7\% for vertical canopy cover on plot level. The results were clearly improved by introducing a new procedure to compensate for unevenly distributed laser points. In conclusion, ALS has strong potential as a data source to map mountain birch biomass in the forest–tundra ecotone, even when using sparse point density ALS data.},

  abstract = {The subalpine zone is the transition between forest and alpine vegetation communities. In Norway, as in many other nations, low productivity or non-merchantable forests, like the subalpine zone, are not routinely subject to inventory programs. Awareness of expected changes in the sub-alpine zone as a result of a warmer climate, and the interest in full carbon accounting at the national level, has dictated a need for data capture in these mountainous areas. We propose an approach for integrating strip samples of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data with Landsat imagery to delineate the subalpine zone. In the current study the subalpine zone was defined according to international definitions based on tree heights and canopy cover. The three-dimensional measurements of forest structure obtained from LiDAR enable a delineation of the subalpine zone. The approach was implemented using 53 LiDAR sample strips in Hedmark County, Norway, and validated with field measurements at 26 locations. The subalpine zone boundaries were found to be within one Landsat pixel, on average, when validated using an image gradient technique. Furthermore, binomial logistic regression was used to upscale the LiDAR classes to the entire county (27400km2) using satellite images and information derived from a digital terrain model. The result from the binomial logistic regression was a probability map suitable for monitoring changes in the extent and location of the subalpine zone. The probability surface was separated into hard classes by calibrated alpha-cuts derived using density estimation to support the information needs of inventory stratification and area estimation.},

  abstract = {The present study addresses the tree counting of a Eucalyptus plantation, the most widely planted hardwood in the world. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) was used for the estimation of Eucalyptus trees. LiDAR-based estimation of Eucalyptus is a challenge due to the irregular shape and multiple trunks. To overcome this difficulty, the layer of the point cloud containing the stems was automatically classified and extracted according to the height thresholds, and those points were horizontally projected. Two different procedures were applied on these points. One is based on creating a buffer around each single point and combining the overlapping resulting polygons. The other one consists of a two-dimensional raster calculated from a kernel density estimation with an axis-aligned bivariate quartic kernel. Results were assessed against the manual interpretation of the LiDAR point cloud. Both methods yielded a detection rate (DR) of 103.7\% and 113.6\%, respectively. Results of the application of the local maxima filter to the canopy height model (CHM) intensely depends on the algorithm and the CHM pixel size. Additionally, the height of each tree was calculated from the CHM. Estimates of tree height produced from the CHM was sensitive to spatial resolution. A resolution of 2.0 m produced a R2 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.99 m and 0.34 m, respectively. A finer resolution of 0.5 m produced a more accurate height estimation, with a R2 and a RMSE of 0.99 and 0.44 m, respectively. The quality of the results is a step toward precision forestry in eucalypt plantations.},

  abstract = {In current individual tree crown (ITC) delineation methods for high-resolution multispectral imagery, either a spectral band or a brightness component of the multispectral image is employed in delineation with reference to edges or shapes of crowns, whereas spectra of tree crowns are seldom taken into account. Such methods normally perform well in coniferous forests with obvious between-crown shadows, but fail in dense deciduous or mixed forests, in which tree crowns are close to each other, between-crown shadows and boundaries are unobvious, whereas adjacent tree crowns may be of distinguishable spectra. In order to effectively delineate crowns in dense deciduous or mixed forests, a new ITC delineation method using both brightness and spectra of the image is proposed in this study. In this method, a morphological gradient map of the image is first generated, treetops of multi-scale crowns are extracted from the gradient map and refined regarding the spectral differences between neighboring crowns, the gradient map is segmented using a watershed approach with treetops as markers, and the resulting segmentation map is refined to yield a crown map. Evaluated on images of a rainforest and a deciduous forest, the proposed method more accurately delineated adjacent broad-leaved tree crowns with similar brightness but different spectra than the other two typical ITC delineation algorithms, achieving a delineation accuracy of up to 76\% in the rainforest and 63\% in the deciduous forest.},

  abstract = {Monitoring the dynamics of the circumpolar boreal forest (taiga) and Arctic tundra boundary is important for understanding the causes and consequences of changes observed in these areas. This ecotone, the world's largest, stretches for over 13,400 km and marks the transition between the northern limits of forests and the southern margin of the tundra. Because of the inaccessibility and large extent of this zone, remote sensing data can play an important role for mapping the characteristics and monitoring the dynamics. Basic understanding of the capabilities of existing space borne instruments for these purposes is required. In this study we examined the use of several remote sensing techniques for characterizing the existing tundra–taiga ecotone. These include Landsat-7, MISR, MODIS and RADARSAT data. Historical cover maps, recent forest stand measurements and high-resolution IKONOS images were used for local ground truth. It was found that a tundra–taiga transitional area can be characterized using multi-spectral Landsat ETM+ summer images, multi-angle MISR red band reflectance images, RADARSAT images with larger incidence angle, or multi-temporal and multi-spectral MODIS data. Because of different resolutions and spectral regions covered, the transition zone maps derived from different data types were not identical, but the general patterns were consistent.},

  abstract = {The circumpolar taiga–tundra ecotone was delineated using an image-segmentation-based mapping approach with multi-annual MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover data. Circumpolar tree canopy cover (TCC) throughout the ecotone was derived by averaging MODIS VCF data from 2000 to 2005 and adjusting the averaged values using linear equations relating MODIS TCC to Quickbird-derived tree cover estimates. The adjustment helped mitigate VCF's overestimation of tree cover in lightly forested regions. An image segmentation procedure was used to group pixels representing similar tree cover into polygonal features (segmentation objects) that form the map of the transition zone. Each polygon represents an area much larger than the 500m MODIS pixel and characterizes the patterns of sparse forest patches on a regional scale. Those polygons near the boreal/tundra interface with either (1) mean adjusted TCC values from 5 to 20\%, or (2) mean adjusted TCC values {$<$}5\% but with a standard deviation {$>$}5\% were used to identify the ecotone. Comparisons of the adjusted average tree cover data were made with (1) two existing tree line definitions aggregated for each 1° longitudinal interval in North America and Eurasia, (2) Landsat-derived Canadian proportion of forest cover for Canada, and (3) with canopy cover estimates extracted from airborne profiling lidar data that transected 1238 of the TCC polygons. The adjusted TCC from MODIS VCF shows, on average, {$<$}12\% TCC for all but one regional zone at the intersection with independently delineated tree lines. Adjusted values track closely with Canadian proportion of forest cover data in areas of low tree cover. A comparison of the 1238 TCC polygons with profiling lidar measurements yielded an overall accuracy of 67.7\%.},

The international coordinated research programme ‘PPS Arctic’, under the auspices of the International Polar Year, represents one response to this gap in our knowledge. This paper presents preliminary work within one of the four principal research areas of PPS Arctic, the characterisation of spatial variations in vegetation, land cover and land use in the TTI using remote sensing methods. Airborne remote sensing data were collected from a 120 km2 TTI study site near Porsangmoen, Finnmark, Norway in 2004 and 2005. Three datasets were acquired: two sets of multispectral visible-infrared imagery with spatial resolutions of around 3 m, and airborne scanning LiDAR data with a horizontal resolution of 2 m and a vertical precision of around 0.2 m. While some difficulties were experienced in processing and analysing the imagery, the LiDAR data proved exceptionally well suited to the task of characterising the structure of the forest edge. Preliminary analyses were strongly suggestive of fractal characteristics, with corresponding consequences for the scale-dependence of descriptors such as canopy density and the location of the forest edge.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses some of the difficulties in establishing the location of the Arctic treeline and forest line on a circumpolar basis, and the contribution that remote sensing, particularly from spaceborne platforms, can make in resolving them. Spaceborne techniques can provide spatial resolutions as fine as a few meters, although the requirements for regional or global coverage are likely to limit the resolution to 30 to 100 m. Since this will preclude the identification of individual trees, the definition of the treeline will be based on statistical parameters estimated from satellite images. The optimum criteria for these parameters remain to be determined. Most remote-sensing observations that are suited to the measurement of the distribution of vegetation, and identification of its type, are based on the visible and near-infrared (VIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, although there is increasing interest in the use of active microwave (radar) techniques. We discuss the basis of both types of approach and the techniques that follow from them, and present 3 case studies from the Russian Arctic.}

Using aerial photography as primary data, we describe a classification technique, incorporating both spectral and spatial information, to provide ecological insights into the scale dependencies of individual ecotone elements. We found that improvements in classification accuracies incorporating both texture and brightness value depend upon window size and texture parameter, indicating that the optimal scale of analysis varies among ecotone classes. Using texture in image analysis of the ecotone highlights scale sensitivities in ecotone components. Therefore, textural analyses may be useful for reducing error in classifications by providing information on the scale at which various landscape patterns operate.},

  abstract = {Technical advances in the field of remote sensing have made it possible to create a large number of datasets with very high spectral, temporal or spatial resolution, however, in the field of archaeology, the evaluation of this data is still largely a manual undertaking. The issue with manual interpretation is that human interpreters are increasingly having difficulty coping with the sheer amount of data while in some cases, the human eye is not capable of processing the full range of information contained in these datasets. It is for this reason that (semi-)automatic classification workflows need to be developed in order to aid human interpreters in their image classification tasks. This thesis is concerned with the development of a Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GeOBIA) workflow for classifying LiDAR visualisations containing heterogeneous and linear objects. The study area that this workflow is applied to is the terraced landscape of the Lower Engadine, Switzerland, where the complex and steep terrain contains multiple agricultural terraces, irrigation/drainage ditches, roads and more. The workflow makes use of only FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications in order to ensure full transparency, accessibility and reproducibility of the classification results. For this purpose, a number of FOSS and proprietary software was tested in order to determine the user friendliness, suitability and effectiveness of each of the options. In order to develop the final workflow, a number of studies regarding the suitability of different LiDAR visualisations as well as training data input options and smoothing filters were carried out. The final workflow makes use of an unfiltered slope visualisation, consists of six steps with an optional seventh step, and is capable of producing classification results that hold up against manual mapping results of the terrace edges that were used as a benchmark. Finally, in order to assess whether the classification results generated by the workflow are useful to a human interpreter, a user study was carried out. 13 out of the 14 users stated that the classification results were helpful to them and because the workflow takes no longer than 5-10 minutes to carry out, it can be said that this workflow is capable of producing a useful classification of the study area with minimal time and effort.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {Questions: Does tree establishment: (1) occur at a treeline depressed by fire, (2) cause the forest line to ascend upslope, and/or (3) alter landscape heterogeneity? (4) What abiotic and biotic local site conditions are most important in structuring establishment patterns? (5) Does the abiotic setting become more important with increasing upslope distance from the forest line? Location: Western slopes of Mount Rainier, USA. Methods: We performed classification analysis of 1970 satellite imagery and 2003 aerial photography to delineate establishment. Local site conditions were calculated from a LIDAR-based DEM, ancillary climate data, and 1970 tree locations in a GIS. We used logistic regression on a spatially weighted landscape matrix to rank variables. Results: Considerable establishment after 1970 caused forest line elevation to increase over 150 m in specific locations. Landscape heterogeneity increased with distance from the 1970 forest line. At a broad spatial context, we found establishment was most common near existing trees (0-50 m) and at low elevations (1250-1350 m). Slope aspect (W, NW, N, NE, and E), slope angle (40-60°), and other abiotic factors emerged as important predictors of establishment with increasing upslope distance from the forest line to restricted spatial extents. Conclusions: Favorable climatic conditions likely triggered widespread tree establishment. Readily available seed probably enhanced establishment rates near sexually mature trees, particularly in the less stressful environment at low elevations. The mass effect of nearly ubiquitous establishment in these areas may have obscured the importance of the abiotic setting to restricted spatial extents. Topographic variability apparently produced favorable sites that facilitated opportunistic establishment with increasing upslope distance from the forest line, thereby enabling additional trees to invade the alpine tundra.},

  abstract = {Throughout interior Alaska (USA), a gradual warming trend in mean monthly temperatures occurred over the last few decades (∼2–4°C). The accompanying increases in woody vegetation at many alpine treeline (hereafter treeline) locations provided an opportunity to examine how biotic and abiotic local site conditions interact to control tree establishment patterns during warming. We devised a landscape ecological approach to investigate these relationships at an undisturbed treeline in the Alaska Range. We identified treeline changes between 1953 (aerial photography) and 2005 (satellite imagery) in a geographic information system (GIS) and linked them with corresponding local site conditions derived from digital terrain data, ancillary climate data, and distance to 1953 trees. Logistic regressions enabled us to rank the importance of local site conditions in controlling tree establishment. We discovered a spatial transition in the importance of tree establishment controls. The biotic variable (proximity to 1953 trees) was the most important tree establishment predictor below the upper tree limit, providing evidence of response lags with the abiotic setting and suggesting that tree establishment is rarely in equilibrium with the physical environment or responding directly to warming. Elevation and winter sun exposure were important predictors of tree establishment at the upper tree limit, but proximity to trees persisted as an important tertiary predictor, indicating that tree establishment may achieve equilibrium with the physical environment. However, even here, influences from the biotic variable may obscure unequivocal correlations with the abiotic setting (including temperature). Future treeline expansion will likely be patchy and challenging to predict without considering the spatial variability of influences from biotic and abiotic local site conditions.},

  abstract = {Because of global warming, it is assumed that the arctic and alpine tree lines will advance northwards into the tundra and upwards into mountainous regions. Methods are needed to monitor these advances. Airborne laser scanning has recently been introduced for detection of small pioneer trees that form the advanced alpine tree line. The objective of this study was to analyze the capability of high-density airborne laser scanning data used for detecting such individual small trees in the transition between the mountain forest and the alpine zone, the forest–tundra ecotone. The study used field and laser data collected along a 1500 km transect stretching from northern Norway (69°3′ N) down to the southern part of the country (58°3′ N). In the field, 744 trees of mountain birch, Norway spruce, and Scots pine were geolocated with centimetre accuracy, and they were measured for height, root collar diameter, and crown diameter. Tree heights ranged between 0.02 and 7.80 m. The laser data were acquired in two separate acquisitions with mean pulse densities of 6.8 m−2 and 8.5 m−2, respectively. Laser echoes with relative height values greater than zero within the individual tree crown polygons were used as a criterion for a successful tree detection. The detection success for trees taller than 1 m was 90\%; however, for trees shorter than 1 m, the corresponding value was 49\%. The highest detection success was found for spruce. Generalized linear models and a generalized linear mixed model with binary responses (detected/not detected) were applied to evaluate the effects of tree height, tree crown area, tree species, geographic location along the latitude gradient, and region on successful detection. Although they were highly correlated, tree height and tree crown area turned out to be the variables showing high significance (p ≤0.001) in all of these models.},

With ITD it is feasible to acquire single tree information, as in field measurements. Here, ITD was used for measuring training data for the ABA. In addition to automatic ITD (ITDauto), we tested a combination of ITDauto and visual interpretation (ITDvisual). ITDvisual had two stages: in the first, ITDauto was carried out and in the second, the results of the ITDauto were visually corrected by interpreting three-dimensional laser point clouds. The field data comprised 509 circular plots (r=10m) that were divided equally for testing and training. ITD-derived forest variables were used for training the ABA and the accuracies of the k-most similar neighbor (k-MSN) imputations were evaluated and compared with the ABA trained with traditional measurements. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) in the mean volume was 24.8\%, 25.9\%, and 27.2\% with the ABA trained with field measurements, ITDauto, and ITDvisual, respectively. When ITD methods were applied in acquiring training data, the mean volume, basal area, and basal area-weighted mean diameter were underestimated in the ABA by 2.7−9.2\%. This project constituted a pilot study for using ITD measurements as training data for the ABA. Further studies are needed to reduce the bias and to determine the accuracy obtained in imputation of species-specific variables. The method could be applied in areas with sparse road networks or when the costs of fieldwork must be minimized.},

  abstract = {[GIS-based data sets were used to analyze the structure of the forest line at the landscape level in the lowlands of the Usa River Basin, in northeast European Russia. Vegetation zones in the area range from taiga in the south to forest-tundra and tundra in the north. We constructed logistic regression models to predict forest location at spatial scales varying from 1 × 1 km to 25 × 25 km grid cells. Forest location was explained by July mean temperature, ground temperature (permafrost), yearly minimum temperature, and a Topographic Wetness Index (soil moisture conditions). According to the models, the forest line follows the +13.9°C mean July temperature isoline, whereas in other parts of the Arctic it usually is located between +10 to +12°C. It is hypothesized that the anomalously high temperature isoline for the forest line in Northeast European Russia is due to the inability of local ecotypes of spruce to grow on permafrost terrain. Observed patterns depend on spatial scale, as the relative significance of the explanatory variables varies between models implemented at different scales. Developed models indicate that with climate warming of 3°C by the end of the 21st century temperature would not limit forest advance anywhere in our study area.]}

  abstract = {In addition to the effects of climate change, land use change is expected to trigger dynamic processes that may shift alpine tree lines upwards. To gain a conceptual understanding of the spatio-temporal processes shaping tree line patterns, we developed an individual-based and spatially-explicit model of spontaneous forest regeneration at the alpine tree line. Remote sensing data were integrated with the succession processes for individual trees in an object based image analysis approach. The model presented here predicts patterns of natural forest regeneration on a summer pasture in the Austrian Central Alps between 1954 and 2006. Different model scenarios are compared to the actual forest regeneration during the study period to validate the model's structure and its sensitivity to changing input parameters. The model's main process parameters are tested in four scenarios: A baseline scenario with the most likely input parameters derived from empirical studies in the literature; and three scenarios with differing parameters for seed production, seed dispersal kernel, and seedling competition with the ground vegetation. The tests largely confirm the model's formulation. The baseline scenario correctly predicts a significant upwards shift of the tree line elevation. Moreover it is demonstrated that (1) fecundity is a crucial factor in the expansion of forest into open land, (2) land cover and land use history have a significant impact on the emergence of forest regeneration patterns and (3) the dispersal kernel of Norway spruce has a long-distance component. We thus identified the key processes operating under environmental change from the characteristics of spatial changes in tree line patterns over the last 50 years.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing can transform the speed, scale, and cost of biodiversity and forestry surveys. Data acquisition currently outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery. We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of 2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes. Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality labeled data.},

  abstract = {Human-mediated climate change over the past century has resulted in significant impacts to global ecosystems and biodiversity including accelerating redistribution of the geographic ranges of species. In mountainous regions, the transition zone from continuous closed-canopy montane forests to treeless alpine tundra areas at higher elevations is commonly referred to as the “alpine treeline ecotone” (ATE). Globally, warming climate is expected to drive ATEs upslope, which could lead to negative impacts on local biodiversity and changes in ecosystem function. However, existing studies rely primarily on field-based data which are difficult and time consuming to collect. In this study, we define an ATE-detection index (ATEI) to automatically identify the ATE positions from 2009 to 2011 in the western United States using geospatial tools and remotely sensed datasets provided by Google Earth Engine. A binomial logistic regression model was fitted between standardized ATEI components and a binary variable of pixel status of 141 sampled Landsat pixels manually classified with high-resolution imagery in Google Earth. The average model accuracy was around 0.713 (±0.111) and the average Kappa coefficient was approximately 0.426 (±0.221) based on a 100-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the ATEI-estimated elevation is highly correlated (Pearson's r~=~0.98) with a published set of field-collected ATE elevations at 22 sampling sites across the region. The detection metric developed in this study facilitates monitoring the geographic location and potential shifts of ATEs as well as the general impact of climate change in mountainous areas during recent decades. We also expect this approach to be useful in monitoring other ecosystem boundaries.},

  abstract = {Savanna landscapes are characterised by a canopy of discontinuous tree cover overlying an understorey of shrubs and continuous grass cover. The distribution of trees (woody cover) is variable both spatially and temporally. Analysis of woody cover dynamics can provide a spatial and temporal envelope encompassing variability is useful for informing mine closure criteria. With the impending closure of Ranger uranium mine, ecologically appropriate closure criteria for ecosystem restoration are being developed through a framework of rehabilitation standards. One such closure criteria is canopy cover and historical woody cover is being used to derive the range in woody cover that can be expected over time once the mine site has been revegetated. This study reports on the development and testing of a technique for extracted woody cover from remotely sensed data (in the form of historical aerial photography and satellite imagery) in the areas adjacent to Ranger uranium mine in the World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. An object-based image analysis technique was applied to four data sets from four different dates: greyscale, true colour and colour infrared aerial photo mosaics (from 1964, 1976 and 1981 respectively) and a high spatial resolution satellite image (from 2010). Overall accuracies of woody cover from each of the data sets exceeded 94\%. In addition, proportional cover derived from this method displays linear relationships to cover derived from visual estimates. Due to the success of the technique, it will be applied to more data sets from different dates over the study area to assess the variability of woody cover over time to inform ecosystem restoration criteria for the mine closure.},

  abstract = {AbstractCharacterization of ecosystem structure, diversity, and function is increasingly desired at finer spatial and temporal scales than have been derived in the past. Many ecological applications require detailed data representing large spatial extents, but these data are often unavailable or are impractical to gather using field-based techniques. Remote sensing offers an option for collecting data that can represent broad spatial extents with detailed attribute characterizations. Remotely sensed data are also appropriate for use in studies across spatial scales, in conjunction with field-collected data. This article presents the pertinent technical aspects of remote sensing for images at high spatial resolution (i.e., with a pixel size of 16 square meters or less), existing and future options for the processing and analysis of remotely sensed data, and attributes that can be estimated with these data for forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles using light detection and ranging (UAV LiDAR) with high spatial resolution have shown great potential in forest applications because they can capture vertical structures of forests. Individual tree segmentation is the foundation of many forest research works and applications. The tradition fixed bandwidth mean shift has been applied to individual tree segmentation and proved to be robust in tree segmentation. However, the fixed bandwidth-based segmentation methods are not suitable for various crown sizes, resulting in omission or commission errors. Therefore, to increase tree-segmentation accuracy, we propose a self-adaptive bandwidth estimation method to estimate the optimal kernel bandwidth automatically without any prior knowledge of crown size. First, from the global maximum point, we divide the three-dimensional (3D) space into a set of angular sectors, for each of which a canopy surface is simulated and the potential tree crown boundaries are identified to estimate average crown width as the kernel bandwidth. Afterwards, we use a mean shift with the automatically estimated kernel bandwidth to extract individual tree points. The method is iteratively implemented within a given area until all trees are segmented. The proposed method was tested on the 7 plots acquired by a Velodyne 16E LiDAR system, including 3 simple plots and 4 complex plots, and 95\% and 80\% of trees were correctly segmented, respectively. Comparative experiments show that our method contributes to the improvement of both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency.},

Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown outstanding performance on this task. Although many deep neural network structures and techniques have been applied to improve the accuracy, few have paid attention to better differentiating the easily confused classes. In this paper, we propose TreeSegNet which adopts an adaptive network to increase the classification rate at the pixelwise level. Specifically, based on the infrastructure of DeepUNet, a Tree-CNN block in which each node represents a ResNeXt unit is constructed adaptively according to the confusion matrix and the proposed TreeCutting algorithm. By transporting feature maps through concatenating connections, the Tree-CNN block fuses multiscale features and learns best weights for the model. In experiments on the ISPRS 2D semantic labeling Potsdam dataset, the results obtained by TreeSegNet are better than those of other published state-of-the-art methods. Detailed comparison and analysis show that the improvement brought by the adaptive Tree-CNN block is significant.},

  abstract = {This study presents a hybrid framework for single tree detection from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data by integrating low-level image processing techniques into a high-level probabilistic framework. The proposed approach modeled tree crowns in a forest plot as a configuration of circular objects. We took advantage of low-level image processing techniques to generate candidate configurations from the canopy height model (CHM): the treetop positions were sampled within the over-extracted local maxima via local maxima filtering, and the crown sizes were derived from marker-controlled watershed segmentation using corresponding treetops as markers. The configuration containing the best possible set of detected tree objects was estimated by a global optimization solver. To achieve this, we introduced a Gibbs energy, which contains a data term that judges the fitness of the objects with respect to the data, and a prior term that prevents severe overlapping between tree crowns on the configuration space. The energy was then embedded into a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) dynamics coupled with a simulated annealing to find its global minimum. In this research, we also proposed a Monte Carlo-based sampling method for parameter estimation. We tested the method on a temperate mature coniferous forest in Ontario, Canada and also on simulated coniferous forest plots with different degrees of crown overlap. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of our proposed method, which was capable of reducing the commission errors produced by local maxima filtering, thus increasing the overall detection accuracy by approximately 10\% on all of the datasets.},
